A closer look at some election data analysis on social media

1. Dominion Switch: Data and code to look at the claim about Dominion software switching votes in many states

a. Trump posted on Twitter that Dominion software deleted his votes and switched those to Biden in many states, https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1326926226888544256?s=20 and https://web.archive.org/web/20201112213944/https://www.oann.com/report-millions-of-votes-lost-through-dominion/. There was also a report from Gateway Pundit about Dominion software deleting votes, etc https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2020/11/breaking-exclusive-analysis-election-night-data-states-shows-millions-votes-either-switched-president-trump-biden-lost/?ff_source=Twitter&ff_campaign=websitesharingbuttons. They said that using some sort of statistical data analysis, they were able to find votes from Trump being transfered to Biden in many states. Here is a picture of their output found on Twitter, https://twitter.com/SysEnfor/status/1326396385651023873. 

b. I read through these claims and figured out that they used the data from NYT. Note that NYT election data is provided by Edison Research. Here is the link to the data in PA, https://static01.nyt.com/elections-assets/2020/data/api/2020-11-03/race-page/pennsylvania/president.json. To access data of other states, you can simple change the name of the state in the URL. For this demonstration, I downloaded data from PA, AZ, GA, MI, WI and they are uploaded in the folder. 

c. I also found where they uploaded their Python script, https://thedonald.win/p/11Q8O2wesk/happening-calling-every-pede-to-/. I uploaded their code in the file ElectionFraud.ipynb just to show you what realy happens if you run the script using data from those states. In fact, the output show that besides Trump, Biden's votes also got deleted and some of those switched to Trump as well. Sometimes, Biden even got more deleted votes. However, those numbers were no where to be found in those reports. 

d. I wrote ElectionFraud_Revisited.ipynb just to show you the raw data in closer look. Here, I even show that if I use the same logic as the code in part c (their code), in some cases, Biden actually lost many more votes than Trump, esp in PA.

____________________________________________________
CONCLUSION: The claim is totally a SCAM!!! You can read the analysis here, https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/11/technology/no-dominion-voting-machines-did-not-delete-trump-votes.html and https://www.11alive.com/article/news/verify/no-evidence-voting-machines-changed-deleted-lost-votes/507-09af017f-e2c6-4328-91b1-bfa2de7b5cb7. I just want to show you a closer look at how misleading their data analysis is, even if I assume their algorithm/logic is correct. 

Now, that is quite a big assummption and I indeed give them lots of leeway when I assume that their thinking is correct to begin with. Their algorithm is based on the observation that sometime in the vote count time series, the vote counts at time t is less than the vote count at time t-1. So when they find there is a decrease in vote count for Trump but an increase in vote count for Biden, they tally that as vote switching from Trump to Biden and vice versa. Another thing I should mention is that if you look at their code in the file ElectionFraud.ipynb, whenever their is a vote lost of Trump or the third party, they automatically assume that those votes would be first transferred to Biden. That is such a big assumption to make. How on the earth do they know that the counting software would move vote from either Trump or third party first to Biden before anyone else? And this is where their logic does not add up. If you look at time t and time t-1 (which you can find in ElectionFraud_Revisited.ipynb), they are really closed to each other. So this can be a typos. This can also be a mismatch in data reporting at each preccint and was fixed soon after that. With this logic, maybe ones can check data from previous election (like 2018) and see if we can see similar pattern of vote counts at time t less than vote count at time t-1 for some t. Another way to check what is going on is to look at time series data at each county to track down exactly which county has the vote count decrease at time particular timepoint. 

Or it can also be some irregularities like they point out, but to go from irregularities to claiming something as a fraud is a HUGE step that they FAIL to show. As I mentioned above, even if I give them all the credits for their logic, the output from their own codes show that Biden lost some votes to Trump too and sometimes that numbers are way bigger than Trump's numbers. 

In a sense, this code ASSUMES that the counting machine has software problem and shows you a (possible) outcome if their assumption is correct (yet they did not show you the entire picture/data). However, this code has NOT PROVEN anything about software problem like Trump or OANN or Gateway Pundit claimed.
